00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.814
This video will cover

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.440
how to enter new patients and how

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:10.760
to look up existing patients in ANDHII.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.880
The patient list is your home screen
and from here you will use it

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.360
to enter new patients or to look up
previously entered patients.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.880
From here you will be able
to review patient information,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.680
return to an incomplete visit entry,
or start a follow up visit entry.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.760
As a new user,
your patient list will be empty.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.134
You can add your first patient
by clicking the Add Patient button

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.840
to the right of the search bar.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.894
Patients in ANDHII are sorted
into projects based on the purpose

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.560
for which they were entered.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.400
This helps us in aggregating the data
so that we know, for example, that data

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.320
from a research study is kept separate
from general practice data.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.014
Most users will be assigned to two
projects, Education and Practice and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.120
the National Quality Improvement Pool.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.094
The Education and Practice project
is a project you can use to practice

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
recording data into ANDHII.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.374
The National Quality Improvement Pool
is a project that you can

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.640
use to enter real patient data.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.454
Data entered in the National
Quality Improvement Pool can be used

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.160
for quality data aggregation efforts.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.480
If you are involved in a special project
that uses ANDHII, for example

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.120
a research study, you may have
other projects you are assigned to.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.854
After verifying the correct project
is selected, you will enter the patient's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
country and state of residence.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.534
Unless you are involved in a special
project using ANDHII, the platform only

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.360
collects de identified data.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.960
You will not be able to enter names,
medical record numbers, addresses,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.880
or other patient identifiers.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.600
Once you indicate the country
and state of residence for the patient,

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.160
click Create Patient.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.600
This will take you
to the Visit entry screen.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.920
We're going to go over this
in detail in a future video.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.454
At any time, you can click Patients
in the navigation bar

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.440
to get back to your patient list.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
If you're in the middle of a visit,
make sure you scroll to the bottom

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.360
of the page and save your work.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.040
There will be more information
on saving visits in a different video.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.720
Before we leave this page, take a moment
to look at the patient info area.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.160
You'll notice that your patient has
been assigned a re identification code.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.254
This is the one type of patient identifier
that is permitted by HIPAA and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.160
the purpose of this nonsense string
of letters and numbers is to let you,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.880
the provider, keep track of which of
your patients this ANDHII entry represents.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.120
Using this code, you'll be able
to search for this patient in ANDHII.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.614
From there you will be able to record
follow up visits or access your data

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.960
to create charts and graphs to highlight
your patient's outcomes data.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.760
You'll need to keep track of this code.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000
There's no possible way for us to help you
link any records back to real patients.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.040
If the code is lost, you also
have some responsibility for the code.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.880
In order to keep the data
in ANDHII de identified,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
you must keep the code secure.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.400
Never share anything that links the code
to the patient outside of your facility.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.654
We recommend that you store
the reidentification code in

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.080
your patient's medical record in the
free text portion of your progress note.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.894
Security measures that exist
for the medical record should be in place

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.440
to keep the code and the link
to the patient's information safe.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.080
Let's return to the patient list
to learn more about managing patients.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.734
I'm going to copy this
reidentification code to make it easier

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.680
to locate this patient later in practice.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.574
You can copy the reidentification code
from the progress note that you saved it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.240
to so that you're able to search
for the patient in the patient list.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.960
The patient list will accumulate
every patient that you enter into ANDHII.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.294
You can choose how many patients
to show on your patient list,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.814
and you can navigate through the pages
of patients by clicking the arrows

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.320
at the bottom of the list.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.800
However, the best way to find a specific
patient is to use the search box.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.520
In the search box, you can type
all or part of a reidentification code

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.760
to filter the list and hide
the patients that don't match.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.680
When I paste the code
that I copied earlier,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.720
the other patients disappear and only
the one matching patient is available.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.920
You'll have access to a few buttons
for each patient on the patient list.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.400
The first button is the New Entry button.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.094
The New Entry button is one way to start
a new entry for a patient for whom

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
you've already entered an initial visit.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.840
The second button is
the View Patient button.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.280
The View Patient button takes you
to your patient's details.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.014
From here, you can view previously
entered visits or continue a visit

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.520
that you haven't finished.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.174
You can also view your patient's
details directly on the patient list

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.440
by clicking the Show Details arrow.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.854
From here you can edit the patient's state
and country, access a previously entered

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.494
visit, start a new follow up entry
for the patient, or view and download

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.880
a summary report of the patient's visit.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.080
You will also see a red circle
under Incomplete Entry.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.934
This is a quick way to tell from
your patient list whether the patient

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.400
has an entry that has not been finalized.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.840
If this is the case, you
will need to return to the visit

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
to finish the entry and finalize.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.134
If you see the red circle under Incomplete
entry, you can click on the arrow to show

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.400
details Incomplete entries are marked
with an exclamation point in a circle.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.200
You can navigate to an incomplete entry
by clicking on the entry date.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.294
You can also navigate to a complete entry
by clicking on the entry date, but

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.560
you will not be able to edit the entry.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.200
That's all there is to
creating and managing patients.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.174
In the next section of videos,
we'll explore how to enter data

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.960
for your patient visit.
